claude "I want to set up a GitHub repository for my PLAYGROUND project under my GitHub username 'kevdozer1'. The repository should be called 'gsplat_RL_playground'. Here’s what to do:

1. If the current directory (/mnt/c/Users/Kevin/playground_rl) isn’t a Git repo, initialize it with 'git init'.
2. Create a new public GitHub repository named 'gsplat_RL_playground' using the GitHub CLI ('gh repo create kevdozer1/gsplat_RL_playground --public --readme') or API if CLI isn’t available.
3. Set the remote origin: 'git remote add origin https://github.com/kevdozer1/gsplat_RL_playground.git'.
4. Stage all files: 'git add .'.
5. Commit with the message: 'Initial commit: PLAYGROUND project with multi-shape RL environment'.
6. Push to the main branch: 'git push -u origin main'.
7. Confirm the repository URL (https://github.com/kevdozer1/gsplat_RL_playground) and verify the code is uploaded.

Execute these steps and let me know when the repository is live."
